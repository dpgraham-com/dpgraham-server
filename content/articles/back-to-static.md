## This Website is Not Forever...

I've been using this website as my personal lab for a little while now.
As of today (2023-06-28), [dpgraham.com](https://dpgraham.com) has been up continuously for 526 days<sup>1</sup>, during
that time, it's consumed 104.8 KWh of juice.

But, this website is not forever.

When I transitioned the site to single page application (SPA), I knew I was crazy. But now I know why!
When the day comes, and I'm ready, dpgraham is going back static content.

### Going SPA is a lot of work

It's like reinventing the wheel!

There's routing, this syntax you have to use called JSX (I'm not sure if I can use vanilla JavaScript anymore it's been
so long). Simple things like the [Document Title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)
become a
custom written hook.

Not to mention all new stuff that was (in some form or another) already taken care of (or is not a problem) by the
server like SEO, authorization, and security.

Don't even get me started on the '[virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html)'<sup>2</sup>.

### What Chu Gonna do?

Like I've siad, this site is a portfolio builder. It's a place for me to try new stuff. I'm sorry to poor soul who
stumbles upon this looking for original content.

Having said that, as soon as I'm over this (what seem like a never ending) learning kick, it's back to HTML, CSS, and
NGINX baby!

There been a couple of times when I needed to reset the home router for unrelated reasons, but it's been going pretty
well!*
