# DPGraham-server

The backend, documentation, and infrastructure as code for my overkill personal website I use to skill up, show off my
portfolio, and blog.

You can find the front end in a separate
repo [dpgraham4401/dpgraham-client](https://github.com/dpgraham4401/dpgraham-client).

## Documentation

See our documentation in the [docs](./docs/README.md) directory which info on design, infrastructure as code,
CI/CD, decision rationale, and more.
